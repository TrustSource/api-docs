# TrustSource's API docs and guidance

This repo contains information about the TrustSource API v2. Beginning of 2024 TrustSource released the second version of its API. While the first version has been providing simple access to objects, v2 aims to really support users in their automation efforts as well as to deliver added value as a standalone service. Besides just giving a hand on the usage, we also maintain a section where we collect use cases and additional solutions on how to tackle obstacles in the sphere of Software Supply Chain Security. Feel free to browse through and commit your experiences and solutions.

The documentation itself is continuously updated to keep pace with the change. However, it will carry a version number and older versions will be kept for later reference. To get an idea of the changes and updates a CHANGELOG is maintained.

This solution is built on top of MKDocs by [Martin Donath](https://github.com/squidfunk).
