## Introduction
TrustSource helps in providing Security and Compliance along the Software Supply Chain. Since large parts of these tasks, if not already, will be automated, a capable API is an important success factor to successfully securing the Software Supply Chain. At TrustSource we focus on leveraging our customer's efficiency through optimal integration. We provide a collection of servcies and tools to simplify operations, to keep their back free from the hazzle and insufficiencies comprising the tooling landscape around open source compliance and security. TrustSource has been assembled over years to support a fully managed solution coping with all aspects of Software Supply Chain Security. 

However, if you feel like something is missing or should be integrated better, please do not hesitate to participate or reach out to us, so that we may explore on how to bridge the gap.

## Migrating APIv1 to APIv2

The APIv2 has been implemented during December 2023. Meanwhile (Oct/24) v1 is not even supported anymore. However, some of our older scanning tools may still want to connect to https://app.trustsource.io/api/v1/... To switch API, you should upgrade to the Ã¶atest version or find the config file, where to set the target URL. See the corresponding repo for details. To find the repo use [TrustSource Repo Overview](https://github.com/trustsource) as starting point for your search.

To migrate, you will just need to point your requests to the URL [https://api.trustsource.io/v2/](https://api.trustsource.io/v2/) instead the the former https://app.trustsource.io/api/v1/ base url. ***All functionality is fully backward compatible.*** To learn about new functionality and experiment/play with the functions, visit the API documentation inside [TrustSource Service](https://app.trustsource.io/apidoc-latest).
